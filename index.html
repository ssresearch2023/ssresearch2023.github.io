<h1>Security Standardisation Research Conference 2023</h1>

<p>The Security Standardisation Research Conference 2023 is the 8th iteration of the SSR conference series, launched in 2014.</p>

<p>Over the last two decades a very wide range of standards have been developed covering many aspects of cyber security. These documents have been published by national and international formal standardisation bodies, as well as by industry consortia. Many of these standards have become very widely used - to take just one example, the ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards has become the internationally adopted basis for managing corporate information security.
Despite their wide use, there will always be a need to revise existing security standards and to add new standards to cover new domains. The purpose of this conference is to discuss the many research problems deriving from studies of existing standards, the development of revisions to existing standards, and the exploration of completely new areas of standardisation. Indeed, many security standards bodies are only beginning to address the issue of transparency, so that the process of selecting security techniques for standardisation can be seen to be as scientific and unbiased as possible.</p>

<p>The SSR conferences are intended to cover the full spectrum of research on security standardisation, including, but not restricted to, work on cryptographic techniques (including ANSI, IEEE, IETF, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27, ITU-T and NIST), security management, security evaluation criteria, network security, privacy and identity management, smart cards and RFID tags, biometrics, security modules, and industry-specific security standards (e.g. those produced by the payments, telecommunications and computing industries for such things as payment protocols, mobile telephony and trusted computing).</p>
